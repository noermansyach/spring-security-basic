# Spring Security Basic with MySQL and Java 17 (Role-Based Access Control)

## Project Description

This project demonstrates a **Spring Security Basic** application built with **Java 17**, **Spring Boot**, and **MySQL** for **role-based access control (RBAC)**. The focus is on restricting access to certain APIs based on the roles of the users (e.g., `USER`, `ADMIN`) without the need for a login mechanism. The project uses **Spring Security** to manage access to different endpoints, with **MySQL** as the data source for storing user and role data. **Maven** is used for dependency management and build automation.

## Features

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Restrict access to certain API endpoints based on user roles.
- **MySQL Database Integration**: Store user and role information in a MySQL database.
- **Spring Security**: Configures authorization to protect endpoints based on user roles.
  
## Technologies Used

- **Java 17**: Latest long-term support (LTS) version of Java.
- **Spring Boot**: Framework for building Java-based applications.
- **Spring Security**: Provides authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- **MySQL**: Relational database for storing user and role data.
- **Maven**: Build automation and dependency management tool.
